    /*
      A DAY06.Constructor is a block of codes similar to the method.
      It is called when an instance of the class is created,
       At the time of calling the constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
        It is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object. Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.

        NOTE--
        It is not necessary to write a constructor for a class. It is because the java compiler creates a default constructor (constructor with no arguments) if your class doesnâ€™t have any.
